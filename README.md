Loan Default Prediction Model
XGBoost machine learning model to predict loan defaults, reducing features through correlation analysis and Random Forest feature importance. Used SMOTE to handle 
class imbalance and applied cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning. Implemented SHAP for model interpretability to 
explain predictions, achieving strong performance across accuracy metrics.
