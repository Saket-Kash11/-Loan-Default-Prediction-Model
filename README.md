Loan Default Prediction Model
XGBoost machine learning model to predict loan defaults, reducing features 
from 120+ to 20 key predictors through correlation analysis and Random Forest feature importance. Used SMOTE to handle 
class imbalance and applied cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning. Implemented SHAP for model interpretability to 
explain predictions, achieving strong performance across accuracy metrics.
